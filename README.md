Hey Hi! I’m Fahad Shakil, a developer who enjoys turning ideas into things people can actually use.
Most of my work revolves around MERN stack development, but I also spend plenty of time in the DevOps world, tinkering with pipelines, cloud services, and deployment strategies.

Here’s what gets me excited:

🖥 Frontend: Building fast, clean, and responsive interfaces with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
⚙️ Backend: Crafting secure APIs and solid backends with Node.js & Express.
🗄 Databases: Making data behave — whether it’s MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
☁️ DevOps & Cloud: Dockerizing apps, orchestrating with Kubernetes, and running things on AWS.
📈 Optimization: Shaving off load times, boosting performance, and making things scale without breaking.
Right now, I’m diving deeper into:

Terraform for automating infrastructure
Smarter Kubernetes setups
Ways to cut down cloud costs without losing performance
💡 My approach is simple: “If it can be built, I’ll build it. If it can be automated, I’ll automate it. Then I’ll make it faster.”

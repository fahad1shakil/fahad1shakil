# Hi there, I'm a Full Stack Developer! 👋

I am dedicated to building scalable, high-performance web applications. My journey is defined by a continuous drive to master modern technologies—transitioning from the core **MERN Stack** to engineering robust solutions using **Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL**.

I don't just write code; I focus on the entire development lifecycle. From designing efficient database schemas with **Prisma** to containerizing applications with **Docker** and deploying them on **AWS**, I ensure that the software I build is production-ready and maintainable.

### 🚀 Technical Core

- **✅ Modern Frontend:** Building interactive, responsive UIs with React.js, Next.js (App Router), and Tailwind CSS.
- **✅ Robust Backend:** Developing secure, type-safe APIs using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.
